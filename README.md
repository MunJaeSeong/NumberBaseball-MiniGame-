This Game was produced as a university activity.

**How to Play**
At the start of the game, a unique four-digit number from 1 to 9 is determined.

You must match these four numbers.

If the position and number match, it's a strike. If only the number matches, it's a ball.

Match the four-digit number in 10 or fewer attempts.
